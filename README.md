# GPTbrowsingservice
a custom made browser designed by me with some use of chatgpt
check releases for the exe application, the raw python file can also be found in releases
 for the browsers images and icon, those can be found on the main repository page, make sure the images are in the same folder as the exe or python file or they wont be in the browser, to use the icon create a shortcut and change the shortcuts icon image to the one in the repository
